## Ghost vs Monsters OOP 2.0 ##

This repo contains the complete app _Ghost vs Monsters_ re-written in an object-oriented style of programming. It's intended as a example of how one might separate functionality within a Corona mobile application.

**This new version has been modernized for changes over past three years with the Corona SDK engine, DMC Corona Libraries, as well as my coding/organization style.** :)

The original Ghosts vs. Monsters was a physics-based game template designed for mobile devices. It was created by Jonathan Beebe and Biffy Beebe for Corona SDK (http://coronalabs.com).

Many thanks to everyone at Beebe Games and Corona Labs for making the code publicly available!
